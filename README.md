# BiasLens

## Agentic AI-Powered Fairness Analysis Platform

BiasLens is a lightweight, modular fairness analysis system that uses a multi-agent AI architecture to evaluate and explain bias in machine learning models. It automates dataset profiling, preprocessing, model evaluation, fairness metric computation, and natural-language interpretation through Generative AI.

### Features

-  **5 Specialized AI Agents** for different analysis stages
-  **Automated Data Profiling & Cleaning**
-  **Comprehensive Fairness Metrics**
-  **Natural Language Q&A**
-  **Multi-level Reports** (Technical, Business, Simple)


### Agent Architecture

1. **Data Profiler Agent** - Understands your dataset
2. **Data Cleaning Agent** - Prepares data for analysis  
3. **Bias Detection Agent** - Runs models & computes fairness
4. **Report Generation Agent** - Creates insights & explanations
5. **Conversational Agent** - Answers questions naturally


### Future Enhancements

- Bias mitigation algorithms
- Multi-class & regression fairness support
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)
- Visual dashboards for fairness comparisons
